            “Dr. Kalam was known to be one of the greatest visionaries and achievers of the world. He had a deep
            understanding of the dynamics of goals, dreams and ambitions which can be of somewhat complicated nature
            (look around - how many people say they want to achieve something but that desire is not matched by their
            actions).
            Two things we can understand from this wonderful quote.
            First, if our dreams and goals in life do not wake us up from the bed, then they are probably not our real
            dreams and goals in the very first place. And if still they somehow are, then we have not put habits,
            processes and tools in place to ignite us all the time towards those dreams.
            Second, no dreams can come true without actions. It’s as simple as that. If our thoughts, goals, and
            ambitions are not aligned with our actions with equal power, then there would not be the desired results.”

            <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam(15 October 1931- 27 July 2015) was an
                Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He
                was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent
                the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
                Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately
                involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.
                <br><br>
                Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the
                pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of
                Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother
                Ashiamma was a housewife.His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and
                forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.Kalam was the youngest of four
                brothers and one sister in his family.His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and
                landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found
                in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family
                business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka,
                as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban.
                <br><br>
                Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential
                election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term
                lasted from 25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007.[39]

                On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, expressed that
                they would nominate Kalam for the post of President,and both the Samajwadi Party and the
                Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy.After the Samajwadi Party announced its support
                for Kalam, Narayanan chose not to seek a second term in office, leaving the field clear.
                <br><br>
                Days afterwards, Mulayam Singh Yadav backed out, leaving Mamata Banerjee as the solitary supporter.
                On 18 June 2012, Kalam declined to contest the 2012 presidential poll. He said of his decision not to do
                so:

                Many, many citizens have also expressed the same wish. It only reflects their love and affection for me
                and the aspiration of the people. I am really overwhelmed by this support. This being their wish, I
                respect it. I want to thank them for the trust they have in me.
                <br><br>
                In his book India 2020, Kalam strongly advocated an action plan to develop India into a "knowledge
                superpower" and a developed nation by 2020. He regarded his work on India's nuclear weapons programme as
                a way to assert India's place as a future superpower.
                <br><br>
                Religion and spirituality were very important to Kalam throughout his life.He made his own
                spiritual journey the subject of his final book, Transcendence: My Spiritual Experiences with Pramukh
                Swamiji.
